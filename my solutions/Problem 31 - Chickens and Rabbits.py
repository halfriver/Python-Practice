# Problem 31: Chickens and Rabbits
 # We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?

# Original: 07 December 2020

limbs = [35, 94]
chickens = [1, 2]
rabbits = [1, 4]
heads = [1, 1, 35]
legs = [2, 4, 94]

print("We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?")

# build the list of all possible solutions to iterate through
possible = []
valid

no more than 23 rabbits
no fewer than 12 chickens

no more than 35 chickens
no fewer than 

c = chicken legs
C = chicken heads
r = rabbit legs
R = rabbit heads

C + R = 35
R(C) = 35 - C
C(R) = 35 - R

c + r = 94
r(c) = 94 - c
c(r) = 94 - r

2C = c
4R = r

therefore

0.5c + 0.25r = 35
c + r = 94

r = 94 - c
r = 140 - 2c
140 - 2c = 94 - c
46 = c
C = 23
