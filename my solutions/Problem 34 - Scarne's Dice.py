'''
Problem 34 - Scarne's Dice
- Make a turn-based dice game where players compete to reach (or exceed) 100
points by rolling a die.
- Rolling a 1 scores no points and the roller loses their turn.
- Upon rolling a 2 to 6, the player can choose to either reroll or end their
turn. Ending their turn adds the number they rolled to the number of points. A
player can reroll as many times as theyâ€™d like on their turn.
